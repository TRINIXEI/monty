## 0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO
This repository contains solutions to the ALX SE Project (0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO).

In this project, we worked on building solutions to the tasks to solve algorithms and data structure-related problems.

We used the <strong>C</strong> programming language, and the <strong>Monty</strong> scripting language.
